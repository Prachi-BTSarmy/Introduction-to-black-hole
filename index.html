         <h1>Hlo everyone so.. today  have made a new website on Blackhole so i hope you will get to know about it.</h1>

        <p>Umm... This kinda looks dangerous üòÅüòÅ umm. it is right??BUT OK now let's get to know about it.</p>
        <p>Blackhole is a very big place in space it contains soo much gravitational force that it pulls everything inside it. Black holes can be big or small. Scientists think the smallest black holes are as small as just one atom. These black holes are very tiny but have the mass of a large mountain. Mass is the amount of matter, or "stuff," in an object. Scientists think the smallest black holes formed when the universe began Scientists think the smallest black holes formed when the universe began.Scientists think the smallest black holes formed when the universe began.</p>
        <p>Stellar black holes are made when the center of a very big star falls in upon itself, or collapses. When this happens, it causes a supernova. A supernova is an exploding star that blasts part of the star into space..</p>

            <p>So solar system has 8 planets and a fire ball called sun.
Venus	8.8 gravitational force
Earth	9.8 gravitational force
Moon (satellite)	1.7 gravitational force
Mars	3.7 gravitational force
 Jupiter	24.7 gravitational force
Saturn	10.5 gravitational force
Uranus	9.0 gravitational force
Neptune  11.7     gravitational force
